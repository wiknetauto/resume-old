# WikTech Resume Project
Hello! My name is Nathan Wikman, and I've worked in systems administration and networking since 2018. Having used PowerShell frequently for automating Windows systems administration (with some C/C++ programming experience in college), learning JavaScript felt like an easy transition and incredibly fun, and I've fallen in love with it more as I continue to discover how powerful it can be.

I will be continuing to build out this resume project, adding new features as I expand my knowledge of web development, and I'm excited to see where this goes!
